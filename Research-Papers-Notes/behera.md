## Abstract

* Quantum cheques could be a forgery-free way to make transaction in a quantum networked banking system with perfect security against any no-signalling adversary,
* Here, we demonstrated the implementation of quantum cheque, proposed by Moulick and Panigrahi, using the five qubit IBM quantum computer.
* Appropriate single qubit, CNOT and fredkin gates are used in an optimized configuration.
* The accuracy of implementation is checked  and verified through quantum state tomography by comparing results from the theoretical and experimental density matrices.
